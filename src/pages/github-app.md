To make the comment system work, we need a mechanism to authenticate GitHub users, in this project, we use [GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps).

## Create a GitHub App

Go to [github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) to create a new app. Let's focus on the essentials:

1. **GitHub App name**  
    
   Give your app a name, this might be the hardest part ðŸ¤¡.
   
2. **Homepage URL**  
   
   You can fill it with the URL of your blog.

3. **Callback URL**  
   
   You can use mine if you want to: https://cwgi.jw1.dev/callback

   If you want to use your own Callback URL, the [next guide](/server-side) will show you how to configure a back-end to handle this callback.

4. **Expire user authorization tokens**  

   We don't need to expire user tokens, so just uncheck this one.

5. **Webhook**  
   
   Also, we don't need this, uncheck.

6. **Permissions**  
   
   We'll only need the permission to **read and write** Issues, Metadata will automatically become **read-only**.
   
7. **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**  
   
   Choose _Only on this account_, this should be the default option.

Okay, now click _Create GitHub App_, a new GitHub App should be created in your account now.

## Private key

After the app is created, you will see this message:

Private keys are used to sign access tokens, this function is related to _expire user tokens_, and we just unchecked this option. So, all we need to do is to generate the private key and forget about it.

## Install the app

On the left side (bad design imo), choose _Install App_, and then click the _Install_ button. You should be directed to the installation page.

In this page, you can further configure permissions for your app, I'd recommend you to _only select the repo that stores the issues_ for your blog.
